// hierarchical, non linear, consists of nodes connected
// linear DS time requires is proportional to inputs which is not for tree

// ex: file system, family tree, org tree, chat bot, DOM, abstract syntax trees

// parent(immideate predecessor) and child node (immideate successor), root node(1st node, with no parent node), leaf node(with no child node)
// siblings (with same parent), sister node, ancestor
// path
// distance(how many nodes in between)
// degree of node(how many child nodes)
// degree of tree(max degree of a node in the tree)
// depth of a node(no of edges to the root; depth of root node is 0)
// height of a node(no of edges from the deepest leaf to that node)
